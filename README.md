# VBA_Challenge_Assignment2
## Overview of Project ##
### Project Details ###

  This analysis gives Steve an overall breakdown of the  raw data from the New York Stock Exchange for 12 Tickers. Steve provided us with two years of data which he needed a breakdown analysis to find “total daily volume” and “yearly returns”. Steve was tasked with controlling his parent’s portfolio. 
  
## Results ##
### Code Breakdown ###

  After executing our code, we can clearly see that the top performers for “2018” fiscal year were ENPH and RUN. Our code runs through the raw data of 2018 adding up all daily volume per ticker and subtracting price from the price to get the yearly return. See picture below:

## Summary ##
### Disadvantages & Advantages ##
  It is not that many disadvantages but one of the major ones is risking the existing code from working properly. But for advantages its several: much fresher code, faster code and reduce memory size.

  Disadvantage from the original VBA script was the limitation on compiling the raw data and also breaking up different variations (Formatting etc) of the code. Advantage with the refactoring script cut the time in half to get done and easier to read through.
